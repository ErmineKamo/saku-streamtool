"Kyaaa,
White Day is finally here! 

I wonder what I'm getting, 
I wonder what I'm getting, 
I'm~ so~ excited!"

This was a day that Asmodeus, who'd rather have love affairs over food, had been looking forward to with much anticipation.

"So, on White Day, you get back what you've given away on Valentine's Day?"

Belphegor asked that. She understood something in theory, but not so much in practice.

For once, Asmodeus, the youngest child, answered her older sister's question excitedly.

"White Day is... 

White Day isn't just some day you get some candy in return for Valentine's Day!

It's a response to the love you've given your partner, so you can feel it deepen, 
and look forward to quiet and peaceful time together with them, an event that's both ancient and refined!"
"And, of course, it's not just about weighing the value of the love you've exchanged, that would be boooring!

It's about choosing a stylish response with the proper cost and value. That's why it's so awesome!"

"You get to gauge the heat of your feelings against theirs, become more intimate,
and take advantage of the sudden meeting with your beloved, that's what White Day is about!
<Do you OK>, sis?"
"...I see.
It seems to be an event with deep significance..."

"I'm sooooo excited!
I can't wait to see what Gohda gives me~!
As far as I know, he went to learn how to make chocolate to Belgium!

So I'm sure he'll give me white chocolate in return!"

"Forget about love, the sweetness of chocolate is much more bewitching~ Nnnooommm~~ "
"I'm soooo excited!
I'm looking forward to what Amakusa got me, too~!

He's soooo cool, and has such good taste~!
It's not gonna be something lame like candy~!

Maybe it's jewelry? 
Make-up? 
Or perfume?!

Kyaa, 
I can't wait!"

Asmodeus and Beelzebub, being the youngest sisters, had a good relationship.

The older sisters had the strange feeling that they were being left out of the excitement.

"Is it really that exciting?
How pathetic for high level furniture to be acting that way."

"Mammon, didn't you give yours to Sakutaro?
Do you really think you'll get something back?"

"Sort of.
Lady Ange said we should have a White Day Tea Party, so we made plans.
We'll have a lovely time sipping tea."

"You certainly have been seeming more impressive lately, Mammon~!
So close with the group from '98~!
I'm sooo jealous. What ever happened to sisterly love?!"

"I want as much love as possible, myself.
I suppose that's greed for you. *giggle*"

Mammon chuckled about getting to one-up her sisters, however slightly.

Surprisingly enough, she valued her relationships with people.

It seemed she was also greedy for friends.

So it could be said, of all the Seven Stake Sisters, she was the one that had the most of them.

The three youngest sisters had their schedules pretty much set, and so, they were looking forward to White Day.

But the older sisters, not being experienced with White Day and unsure of what to expect, were waiting with some amount of trepidation.

"You gave chocolate to Rudolf, right, Belph?
...Are you expecting something back?"

"H-he said he didn't know what to get me,
...and suggested we go shopping together."

"Oh, really?!

And, did you agree?!"

"Um, ...well...
I said I thought that helping middle aged men in their laziness was one of my duties..."

"Wah, 
Belphegor is mean, 
mean! 
Fine! Then I'll go on a date with Kyrie, too!~"
"...Lucky you, Belph.
Sounds like you're going to have an exciting day."

"A-an entire day to make Rudolf lazy!
Levia, you better not interfere!"
"I won't get in your way, I'll just be jealous along with Kyrie!
You'll have two pairs of envious eyes following you the whole way!"

"
#$&!

*#%
$+%!"
Acting unlike her normal self, Belphegor gestured wildly at Leviathan in argument, voices raised.
...From an outside perspective, it looked like they were having fun.

Satan and Lucifer were the only two left.
For some reason, these two were always the last ones to catch on to things.

"All of them are raising such a fuss.
This is an embarrassment to the Seven Sisters!"

"What about you, Satan?
You gave Kanon chocolate, right?"

"...More like, I forced him to take it.
Even if I wanted something from him, I don't think I'd get it."

Last Valentine's Day, she'd tried to give Kanon chocolate,
only to meet with suspicious refusal before Jessica had chased her off.

She ended up just throwing the chocolate at him.
He probably didn't even realise it was being given to him.

After that, it was unlikely that she'd get anything back.

Satan was very prideful.
She had spent the last month feeling terrible because she had been the only one whose Valentine's Day went so badly.

Suddenly, they noticed that another person was there.

Turning around, they noticed Kanon standing there, with an alienated look on his face.

He might have been there for a while, 
since Satan and Lucifer were so engrossed in talking that they wouldn't notice him anyway.

"K-Kanon!.. What are you doing here?!"

Satan cried in bewilderment.
...With that shameful outburst, Satan realized the reason he must have appeared, and her face grew bright red.

But Kanon had no sensitivity towards the girl's feelings.
To him, she appeared in the same foul temper as always.

"...You threw chocolate at me on Valentine's Day.
...I was annoyed, but I figured it would be impolite not to return you the favor."

After saying that, Kanon reached into his pocket and took out a very small, but beautifully wrapped box and shoved it at her.

He might have said it was a trifle given out of duty. 

However, the wrapping paper made it clear that the brand wasn't cheap.

He was paid quite well as an employee of the Ushiromiya family. 

And since Kanon had no interests and no reasons to use money, he'd ended up with quite a huge amount of it stored up...

"...You say it's out of duty, yet you got me something so high class.
...How ridiculous."

"...Don't worry.
I just picked it up at the same place I was getting Milady's gift.
It wasn't worth going to a cheaper store just to get you something."

"...Uh. I see...."

"Very well. My debt is paid.
...Don't bother me again."

And with that, Kanon disappeared.

...Out of all the things spoken on White Day, "I've paid my debt" isn't one you hear very often.
But somehow, it suited their antagonistic relationship, Lucifer thought.

Suddenly, Lucifer was hit sharply on her back.

"Ouch!.. Who!?.."

"Hey there, ass-sis."

"B-Battler!.. You're participating in White Day too?!.."

"You sure are a strange one...
Aren't you the one that gave me that handmade chocolate for Valentine's Day? 
And didn't I promise to give you something in return? 

I might believe that the past is better forgotten,
but do you really think my head is empty enough to forget something from a month ago?"

Battler brandished the box he'd been hiding behind his back with a "ta-da!".

The store must have wrapped it, since it was packaged very neatly, in a way that Battler could have never pulled off.

...The wrapping must have been magical.
It captured a person's attention before they could ask what was inside.
That's how Lucifer felt.

"I thought candy was a little childish.
And I didn't know what sort of jewelry you liked.

So, here.
Since it's tea, it's something most people will like, more or less, and it's still pretty fancy, huh?
I hope you don't hate tea?"

"N-no, 
...I like it..."
"Well, everything's fine then!
Come on, open up.
The smell is amazing!"

Since Battler was pushing her to open it, Lucifer reached towards that lovely wrapping paper.

Sure, she was interested in what was inside, but tearing apart wrapping that was so beautiful seemed like a waste.

It was held in place by a thick, deep red ribbon,
which was, in turn, adorned by a golden butterfly brooch.

"Huh?
Was that always there?.."

"...!"

The butterfly they thought was a brooch began to flap its wings, and took off!

Battler was shocked, but Lucifer, who had already guessed that this sort of trick would be forthcoming, was unnerved in in a different sense.

The golden butterflies scattered and the form of the Golden Witch appeared.

"Waah!?
What the!?"

"Lady Beatrice?!.."

"Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerr!?

You didn't buy that Mariage Freres for meeeeeee!?"
"W-why would I buy tea for you, of all people?!"

"Huh? Ah...umm...
But, but!
Didn't you get something for me for White Day?! 
I've been so excited! I've waited sooooo long for this day to come!"

"And I saw you going into that lower level of the department store and picking out that expensive tea!
And then, choosing that pretty wrapping paper in to show your appreciation for me!
I was so sure it was a present for me! I was sure of iiiiiit!"

"And then, it turns out it wasn't for me at all, but for my furniture!!! 

GrrrrrrrrrrrrRrrrrrrrrrrrr!"

"Owowowow, 
Lady Beatrice, please stop 
chewing my hair!"
"Ah, what are you doing to your subordinate?!
Have some shame! I got this for Lucifer because of the chocolate she made for me!"

"Eeeeeehh?!
Then, where's my present?!"

"I didn't get you anything. It's not like I got any chocolate from you."

"Huh?!
But I gave you hand-made chocolate!"

"You lied to me and said you made it, even though it was Lucifer's! So I gave it back!"

"...Oh, now that you mention it...
I think I ate it with my tea that afternoon..."

"Was it good?"

"Yes, it was delicious."
Beato had forgotten all about the chocolate Battler had given back until her afternoon tea, when she discovered it and proclaimed: 'Oh, what's this delicious looking chocolate doing here!?'. 

Then, she nibbled it all up like a squirrel.

"...
...Do you have the brains of a squirrel too?
...In any case, I didn't get any chocolate from you, therefore, there's no reason for me to get you anything."

"No, that's wrong!

You just decided not to take it! 

I did everything I had to for Valentine's Day properly! 

So you have to give me something for White Day!

White Daaaaaaay! 

I was looking forward to what you were going to get meeeee!"
"Well, I don't have anything.
Heey, if you want to get in a temper tantrum like a spoiled brat, fine. Embarrass yourself all you like. 

Hey, Lucifer,
I've something to say to you.
Thank you for the delicious chocolate on Valentine's Day."

"Um, well...
you see,
...that chocolate was actually..."
As a sign of respect to her master, whose mood was rapidly worsening, Lucifer nervously thought it best to confess that she hadn't made her chocolate by hand either...

But before she could, a muffled sound rang out and the area was enveloped by the smell of tea.
The box of black tea had exploded.

"Kyaaa, *cough, cough, cough*!"

"Beato, you bitch!
How dare you do that to my tea!
*cough, cough, cough*!"

Beato rolled around in laughter as Battler and Lucifer coughed.

"Uhyahyahya!
If I'm not getting it for White Day, then it might as well not exist!
That's what you get, Lucifer! Kihahaha!"
Leaving behind only her voice, Beato vanished in a huge storm of butterflies.

She had misunderstood what type of holiday White Day was.

She thought that if she gave someone chocolate on Valentine's Day,
she would certainly get some sort of exciting present in return on White Day.

So, she had prepared chocolate for Battler in hopes of forcing him to give her something on White Day out of a sense of obligation.

But then, Lucifer had gotten something and she hadn't gotten anything. She didn't like that one bit.

Then, getting all worked up over something so trivial had made her mood even worse.

She suddnely began to hate all that time she had spent under the covers with her hands folded, excitedly waiting until White Day finally arrived...

"Now, show yourselves, Calvary of Pendragon, the Chiester Sisters!"

With a wave of Beatrice's pipe, Chiester 45 and 00 appeared.

"Oh, how unusual.
00 has answered the summons."

"I beg your pardon.
410 is participating in the Heavenly Sniper Exchange Program today.
So please allow me to appear in her stead."

"H, Heavenly Sniper...that's quite a mouthful.
Sounds like some sort of fraudulent excuse for training."

"Ma'am!
Since White Day is a continuation of Valentine's Day, there's too much work for Love Snipers alone to handle. It's customary to request assistance from one of the Imperial Guard Corps."

"...I had no idea.
To think that Cupid could have a shortage of staff..."

"Due to 410's skill as a sniper, countless couples are rumored to form every year."

Grrr.
...An expression of obvious displeasure rose to Beato's face.

And then, a toothy grin, like she was getting ready to rip into something.

"Chiester Sisters, I have a number of targets for you today!
Ready your bows and prepare to fire!"

"U-understood!
45, enter firing preparation mode!
Lady Beatrice,
your targets?"

"*cackle, cackle* More, and more, and even more!

I'm calling this operation..."
And thus...

The peaceful, heartwarming White Day that should have been, 
was ripped into pieces by the Chiester Sisters' shooting... 

The first target:
The small box Asmodeus received from Amakusa.

"Kyaaa!
I just got that from Amakusa!
I didn't even get to see what was insiiide!"
"...That's not important.
I'll just get you another.

More importantly, just be glad that you're not hurt, alright?"

"...Kyaa... 
Amakusa, you're too amazing to be reeeeaaal!"
The next target:
that irritating Amakusa himself.

"What's been lost isn't important, after all-

Ugh?!
Hrrk!"

"Kyaaa, 
Amakusaaaaaaaaa, 
stay strong!!!"
"<C-
...ool...>

...ugh."
The second target:
Gohda's high-class chocolate that Beelzebub was just about to eat.

"Uwaaaaaaaaa!!
Gohda's chocolate just exploded in my mooouuth!"

"Impossible! 

It's the royal family secret recipe! 
Did I make a mistake somewhere!?
Am I still that unskiiiilled?! 
I m-must return to Belgium for further training!"
"F-forget Belgium, just make me another box!
Uwaaaaaa!"

However, Gohda had already left to seek the mystery of Belgian chocolate...

Third target:
The pancakes Ange had made for her tea party with Mammon and Sakutaro.

"A-Ange, Sakutaro, are you alright?!"

"...I had no idea...
that pancakes would become explosive if cooked for too long.
...Good going, me.
I guess there was a reason I got such low scores in Home Economics."

I decided to make some pancakes while we're enjoying the aroma of the tea.

But because I don't make them often, or, rather, I always just buy them premade, I thought I might burn some of them.
...Well, now we're surrounded by burning stench.

"N-no, even if you burn pancakes to charcoal, they shouldn't explode...
Could it be?.."

"...U-uryu.
I'm okay...somehow.
Are you okay, Ange?
What about you, Mammon!?.."

"Sakutaro wasn't targeted,
...does that mean someone from the Alliance is attacking us?!"

Fourth target:
Rudolf, currently shopping with Belphegor.

"R-
...Rudolf, 
are...
are you alright?.."
"Heh. ...So this is the action they took.
Sorry, sweetheart.
...Looks like they mistook you for my woman.
At least I was able to protect you."

Of course they were actually aiming at Rudolf.
Trying to dodge while pretending to protect is one of Rudolf's talents.
And, if it fails, it's the perfect technique for making it look like you were trying to defend someone. 

...And of course, Belphegor, unused to moves like this, was completely taken in.

"W-were they...
aiming at me?..

...But that sniping, ...it can't be..."

"You know, a man that defends a woman can usually be revived with a kiss..."

"I'm not going to f-fall for that one!
Let's get you some medical help right now.

...Ah-"

Fifth target:
Kyrie, currently stalking Rudolf with Leviathan.

"Are you alright!?
Hang in there!
Your wound isn't too deep!.."

"...That was close...
Miss Kyrie, taking this in your stead, 
I, Leviathan of Envy, 
...d-
don't regret anything..."
"Heh.
Even though you're a stake?
*giggle* Don't act so full of yourself.
Let me help you to a hospital."

"Forget about that! I'd rather see you bring down divine wrath upon that cheater, Rudolf...!
I'll watch from here, so please!
S, see, look!
Him, with Belpeghor,

...hiiiiii!"
"...I'll take you to the hospital in a moment.
I hope they have at least a few beds open.

...24*365*679403235843579757598788..."

Sixth target:
The bottle of perfume Satan got from Kanon.

"Ah, 
...but...
just now, were those...
the Chiester sisters?!

...Urk, 
...grk, 
...this must be... 
my punishment for getting caught up in White Day... 

That's right.
Kanon isn't any ordinary rival.
...But he has such good taste,
I thought it might be okay...
It huuurts..."

" Unacceptable! Pull yourself together! I am furniture in service of Beatrice-sama, one of the Seven Sisters, Satan of Wrath!"

"I must not despair...
...just because a gift from him broke!
...*sniff*"

Seventh target:
That tea Lucifer got from ...ahh, whatever.
Just put some holes into that obnoxious Battler already.

"Uuuuooooo, Endless Nine Barrier! 

Deflection!"
"Hii!
He deflected it! He isn't human!" 

"We cannot penetrate this anti-magic barrier!
Please give us our next target, Lady Beatrice!" 

"So you're the one behind this, Beato!
You've been destroying everyone's White Day!
I've had enough of this!" 

"Kihahahahahaha! 

What's the point of White Day if I don't get anything!
If I've wrecked everything, it's just what they deserve! Fwahahahaha! 

Just look at all the White Days I've managed to secretly destroy!" 

With another wave of her pipe, the Chiester Sisters vanished in a puff of smoke, one after the other.

"...Well, my stupid old man got what was coming to him,
but aside from that, you're just horrible...
You damn demonic witch!"

"Kuheeheeheehee!
All I've been doing is making up for the slight given to me this White Day! 
Fear me, 
worship me!
My wrath will continue for seven years, seven months, and seven days! 

From this day forward, both Valentine's Day and White Day will be broken in my name! 

Ahyahyahyahya!"

"...How's that?
Do you regret what you've done?!
I want to hear you say, 'Beato, please forgive me,
I promise I'll get you something on White Day!'
But, don't give me something like what you got for Lucifer, mine better be something more expensiveeeeeeee!""...Quit screwing around.
Who the hell would want to do what a lying, selfish witch like you says?!"

"Mm... ugh..."

Batter's response caused Beato's mood to rapidly change, and she fell silent... 

"Valentine's Day and White Day,
they are all about the feelings that spring from your heart.
Someone who thinks of them as excuses to get stuff doesn't deserve anything."

"Oh, ...oh...
So you're saying I don't have the right to receive anything on White Day?"

"Yeah.
Not at all.
No matter what you do.
I'll even declare it.
I'll declare it in red."

#ff0000 I will never ever, from this day forward, get you something for White Day!#ffffff
Battler said that. 

And though Beato returned his words with a bitter grin, she couldn't help but bite her lower lip.

"Kuhahahahaha, haaahahahahahha! 

Fine, I'll swallow your declaration!
Wahahahahah, kyahahahahahahaha!"

"I hate Valentine's Day!
I hate White Day!
To all you idiots out there, I will never forget this day!
I will not allow another White Day to pass!
Kuhahahaha! 

I will erase White Daaaaaaay!"

"Waaaaaaaaaaah. 

Teaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacheeeeeeeer, 
I... I just... 
wanted something for White Day toooo!"
"Th-there, ...there.
...Did you go and do something thoughtless only to ruin everything for everyone including yourself again?
Oh, there, there..."

"Pukuku...
Good grief.
This was the natural continuation of last month's Valentine's Day story."

"Now that I think about it, it's all your fault, Ronove!
Battler called me a liar because you made that chocolate!"

"My goodness, how regrettable.
I could have sworn I made that chocolate under your orders, Milady. 

And wasn't it delicious?
Wasn't the aroma suitable for even the Quartier Latin?"

"Hm, hmm,
it was good.
I nibbled it all away."

"Then it couldn't have been my fault.
It must have been yours, Milady."

"...That's correct.
You shouldn't blame Ronove."

"Then...
then, it's all Lucifer's 
fault!

She told Battler her chocolate was handmade, and that's why Battler called me a liar!"
"Pukkuku! 

But isn't that exactly the same thing you've done?"

"It isn't Lucifer's fault.
She's furniture that works hard to fulfill your exact commands every day.
I'll be very cross if you misuse her.
Yes, really."

"...Uuuuuugh.
...Well...
It's not Ronove's fault...
It's not Lucifer's fault, 
...so, then... is it Battler's?"

"...Oh, seriously, this child. 

It's just like Battler told you.
Don't make the mistake of thinking White Day is an excuse to be given something."

"Even using Duty-Chocolate as an example, it's said men and women still enjoy the bittersweetness of it. It needs to be done with grace.
...Those who give Valentine's Day chocolate in the hopes of coercing someone to reciprocate on White Day are not elegant."

"Uu...uuuu..."

Even though she was angry at Ronove and Virgilia, there was nothing she could say in response.

Still, it seemed as though she couldn't quite bring herself to accept those feelings,
so she continued biting her lower lip as hot tears rose to her eyes.

"...Now be honest.
You were lonely, weren't you?"

"Uu...

...uwaaaaaaaaaaa!
I wanted to get something on White Day toooo! 

It's not fair, all the Stakes got what they wanted!
Lucifer even got tea from Battler, 
but I didn't get anything, 
and now I'll never get anything 
not next year, not ever! 
It's too sad, 
I caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan't,
uwaaaaaa!"
Beato buried her face in Virgilia's dress as she cried.

Virgilia and Ronove looked at each other and sighed.

"Now listen carefully, Beatrice.
If you want Battler to get you something on White Day,
you have to give him chocolate that you've put feelings into.
It doesn't matter if it isn't well made."

"And if making it proves entirely impossible,
you can go buy one at the store, as long as you choose it with care.
What you need is the desire to make him happy."

"If I do that, Battler will reciprocate on White Day?.."

"As long as you put your feelings into it, he will."

"As far as handmade chocolates goes, I can take a chocolate recipe intended for a professional such as myself, and,
with a cool smile, 
modify it so that even a beginner like Milady can make something sweet.
It's not difficult to make chocolate from your heart."

"...So... next year, if I make Battler Valentine's Day chocolate, 
he won't be in a bad mood anymore? 
...I have to wait until next year?.. 

So that means,
Battler will be looking at me with those cold eyes all this time?
...I don't want that..."
Virgilia sighed and then smiled wryly.

At least Beato had settled down.
All it would take now was time and patience to help her express her thoughts properly.

"Well, Beatrice,
why don't we do this?
...I'll use my most secret spell to turn back time to the day before Valentine's Day."

"...Huh? What?!
M-magic that amazing, a-actually exists?!"

"The ability to turn back time?..
...Who would have thought Madam could use such an impressive, secret spell.

No, I guess it's not so shocking, considering it's you, Madam.
Even now, you're still full of surprises..."

Time Regression.
A skill that could shock even the great demon Ronove.

If Beato used this magic, this time she'd definitely be able to make chocolate and give it to Battler...

"This is not a magic that can be used very often.
I'll use it for you.
But can you promise to not waste this chance?.."

"Y-... Yes.
I understand..."

"Since you will be going back in time, you must struggle against time's currents.
If you relax your guard for even a moment, the spell with dissipate.
Be careful."

"A-alright.
I will."

"Even though I'm the one casting this spell,
you will have to cover the cost of maintaining the world of the past with your own magical power."

"Alright, alright already.
What exactly should I do?"

"You must believe in it.
If you doubt that this is the world of the past, the spell will break. 

That's the basis of magic.
As long as you believe, there's nothing magic can't accomplish."

"I... know that."

"Then, Beatrice,
off you go to the day before Valentine's Day.
This time take it seriously and put your heart into it, alright?"

With a snap of Virgilia's fingers, Beatrice was transformed into a swarm of golden butterflies and transported to the kitchen...

Virgilia and Ronove watched her off...

"Time Regression is quite the tiring art."

"...Indeed it is.
If it was just me, I doubt I'd be able to pull it off."

"Indeed,
even with the two of us, we barely made it."

"Today is the day before Valentine's Day.
Have the calendar, newspaper, televisions and all other related items been attended to?"

"Yes, to my knowledge, madam.
I'll leave the rest to you..."

"Stakes, have you been paying attention?"

""""""Yes, Predecessor!""""""

And thus...

Everything was set a month back to the day before Valentine's Day.

Beato, having been transported to the kitchen, was paging through a recipe book.

On many of the pages were tags with the word 'Easy!' written on them, pointing out chocolate recipes simple enough for even a beginner to make.
Of course, this was prepared by Ronove.

"...If I'm supposed to take this seriously, I can't do something 'easy'!

I'll show them what I can really do!"

...And so, in her enthusiasm, Beato ignored the tags and chose a complicated recipe that looked good...

"Ronove could certainly make this.
And how is it possible that I, Great Lady Beatrice, wouldn't be able to do the same?
I'll make everyone regret underestimating me!
Fwahahahaha!"

"...Good grief.".
Virgilia, watching through the magical three way mirror, sighed. It seems like Beato was hopeless.

Half a day went by in a spectacular violence that would have shocked the culinary world.

Chocolate exploded out of pots. 

Chocolate was sweetly scorched, exploded, and pulverized.

Chocolate grew legs and ran around the kitchen.
Chocolate grew wings and took to the air.

Thus a butterfly net was soon added to Beato's "chocolate-making" utensils...
At this point, you couldn't even call what she was doing "making chocolate"...

However, even though she had failed enough times that the kitchen was coated in chocolate,
and the scent of it hung heavily in the air,
she never forgot her goal.

"This chocolate is absolutely stuffed with my feelings,
considering how hard I've worked to make it!
That damn Battler better accept it and give me something amazing on White Day.
Kihihihi!"

As she laughed while mixing it in the pot, her mind brought forth the words of her Teacher.

"Don't make the mistake of thinking White Day is an excuse to be given something".

...T-that's right.
This is the chance Teacher gave me with her secret ability.

I can't think like that.

That sort of attitude is what I'm trying to solve with this spell.

Beato looked up at the page-a-day calendar that indicated this was the 13th of February, and remembered her last attempt,
before shaking her head and engrossing herself in her work once again.

"Oh, something smells great.
So you've decided to push yourself into candy making, huh, Beato?
I guess this means the world is ending."

"That voice!..
Gaap?"

The refrigerator opened, and Gaap came out of there.

She hadn't actually been lurking in there,
she had just used the fridge door to materialize one of her warp holes.

Since directly appearing so suddenly in front of a friend was rude,
she used the appearance of a door as a measure of small etiquette.

"Did I pick a bad time to come and play?
Are you busy??"

"I don't mind.
You chose a good time to be a test subject for my samples."

"...Considering the condition of the kitchen from your cooking, I might have to think that one over..."

Even Gaap was amazed at the state of things.

But even more than that, she didn't understand why Beato was bothering at all.

"Hey, Beato,
...why are you making chocolate?"

"For Valentine's Day, of course! 
I have to have it done before tomorrow!"

"...

...Isn't it White Day today?"

"..."

...Beato stopped stirring.

From the way the atmosphere froze, Gaap guessed there was something more to this.

But there was no helping what she had said now.

"...I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
You look busy.
I'll just be going now.
See you later."

Beato didn't respond.

Gaap opened another warp portal and vanished into it without another word.

...All that remained was Beato, frozen like time had stopped.

...Of course, 
I ended up... 
starting to doubt...

Such powerful magic...
shouldn't have taken just a snap of Teacher's fingers...
"...*sniff*..."

Salty tears ran down her face.

They fell one by one into the bowl with the melted chocolate.

I'm so foolish, ...I'm such an idiot...

I can't even be angry at anyone.
...It was my fault for being dumb enough to fall for such a ridiculous lie.
...I'm upset at myself more than anything...

How naive.

...And I only found out after I'd finally gotten close to tempering the chocolate.

...Who even cares anymore?
This is stupid. 

This bowl I have in my hands.
I'll get rid of it.

...I have to throw it away.
...I've worked on this for so long.
...This bowl, that I spent so much time on, is stopping me from forgetting all of this.

Why can't I... throw it away? 

All I can do is cry...

Valentine's Day. White Day.

...I wonder why I was so excited about them...

It wasn't really because of love or anything.

But...
I wonder, 
...is this just the season to feel this way?

...The time when the cold weather ends and the air begins to warm...

I wanted...
to experience that with my feelings as well...
I didn't even want to get anything...
"...Uggggh, 
...*sniff*!..
Isn't...
today...
the day before Valentine's Day?..
Why is it the 14th of March?.."
It was too late. 

All of it.
...All of the feelings she had towards experiencing the mysterious Valentine's Day and White Day were already gone...

Ronove just changed the calendar.
It does read "13th of February".

But that's a lie. 

"No matter what it might say, 
...today isn't 2
13..."
"Not 2
13? But what date is it, then?"

"...Battler..."

Why had he come into the Witch's kitchen?..

But she didn't even need to ask before he already answered.

"I came to see what that weird chocolate smell was.
I sure got to see something funny. 

A witch named Beato, working her ass off, making chocolate for tomorrow."

"..."

"...I wonder who she's planning on giving it to.
Well, sure hope it isn't me..."

Battler's acting was terrible. 
If he'd been a little bit better, Beato's wounded heart might have mended slightly. 

But that acting only made Beato smile bitterly... 

...She figured it out by now.

Teacher and Ronove must have spoken to Battler and told him about her laughable circumstances and asked him to help out.

This is pathetic...
Absolutely pathetic...

The Golden Witch Beatrice, one of the world's greatest... acting so absurdly... 

"...Ugggh."

...Battler himself had probably realized how bad his own acting was.

Of course there was no way to continue the deceit with such obvious lies and simplistic acting... 

The most Battler could do now...
was just staying silent not to hurt her even more...

It was time to end the charade. 

If she smirked wickedly at Battler and began to verbally abuse him... 

...things would go back to the way they were before.

...In other words, back to fights and arguments. 

Then, once again, for the last time, she remembered her Teacher's words... 

"You must believe in it.
If you doubt that this is the world of the past, the spell will break.
That's the basis of magic.
As long as you believe, there's nothing magic can't accomplish."

"...That's right...
...*sniff*..."

I'm the Great Witch that can do any sort of incredible magic.

I'll show you... how great... my magic really is!

"Hoh..."

"...Hoh?"

"That's right.
You've figured it out! I'm making chocolate for Valentine's Day tomorrow!"

Even with tears still running down her face... she smiled mysteriously, like a demon attracted by fire.

"You can be sure whoever gets my chocolate is in for a surprise!"

"S-surprise, huh?
Did you put something in there?
They're not poisoned, are they?"

"Rude! 

I'll have you know this is just usual Valentine's Day chocolate!
It's a miraculous holiday that takes place ones a year, when people get chocolate made by women.
I wanted to participate too."

"Heh.
I didn't know you had such a girly side to you."

Strangely,
as the conversation progressed, ...Battler's words became more and more natural-sounding.

And, ...the day began to feel more and more like it really was February 13th...

"I wonder if the person I give this chocolate to will give me anything on White Day?.."

"Of course.
I'm sure they will."

"...Even if there was a red truth that said they wouldn't?
But that's not possible..."

"No,
...it can be done."

"How?"

"They just need to use the blue truth.
Watch."

#5DECFFWhite Day is the on the same day as Valentine's Day, just a month later.
So the person you give your chocolate to tomorrow will pay you back a month later.
#ffffff

"Valentine's Day is tomorrow,
right?"

"Y-yeah?.."

"Then, you'll get your return gift a month after tomorrow.
And since that day a month later isn't technically White Day,
the person you're giving your chocolate to won't be violating the red truth."

"...Hmph. How complicated... 

Ahhh! H-hey, look at what you've done!
I messed up on the tempering again because you were chattering away! 

Now I have to start all over from the boiling water! 

Come help me, my arms are getting tired!"

"Don't be so pushy!
You want me to help, right? 

...Heh, I guess I can spend some time with you, just for today."

*thud*.

It seems there was a noise from the other side of the kitchen, but all that was there was the fridge.

Did the door just close?

"W-what is it?
Your face is bright red. Did I do something wrong?"

"N-never mind that! 

Look, it's boiling, it's boiling! 

This is so much trouble. Maybe I should just dip you in chocolate and shove you in the oven!"

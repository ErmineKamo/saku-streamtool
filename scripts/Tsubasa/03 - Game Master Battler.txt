and this will give us a glimpse of how awesome he was in the past.

"...Alright, this time, the adults will get better roles.
With your plentiful life experience and cunning wit, you'll be able to leave a scratch on the 1000-year-old witch and her familiars!..
Thanks, everyone!
Now that I know what direction to take the story, I might start getting more ideas!"

"Excellent!..
We're glad we were able to help." 

"...Well then, we should probably take our leave.
We wouldn't want to distract you..."

"Thank you very much for your concern!
And for collaborating with me!
I'll be sure to write an awesome scenario and give you guys enough spotlight that you'll all rank in the top 10 in the next popularity poll!" 

Gohda, Kumasawa, Nanjo...
;
and even Genji were choking on tears of gratitude.

Battler, in order to clear away their long-standing regrets, immersed himself even more in the production of the EP6 scenario...

*knock, knock*! Again with the knocking.

Who is it?
...Well, this sure is an unexpected character. 

"Well?
Any progress?"

"Aunt Eva... 
no, wait!
EVA?!
Why are you here!?"

"Oh, uhm, you know.
Which previous episode was the most popular?
The third, "Banquet", right?
And why do you think that scenario was so exciting?
It was because of me, the rival character.
If you have a wonderful scenario, you need to have a wonderful rival to go with it!"

"And even if you wouldn't expect it, I got 8th place in the last popularity poll!
Staying in the top 10 when I've had almost no screentime since EP3, don't you think that's just impressive?
Ufufufufufufu!
I wouldn't mind showing up in EP6 and making things even more exciting."

"*giggle, giggle, giggle* If only you'd just give me a role!"

"No, thank you.

I've already got a fantastic rival."

"W-whaaat?!"

"...She fits the role of an annoying rival just perfectly.
In her nastiness and perversion, she far outshines you."

"Whaaaaaaaat theeeeeee heeeeeeeeeelll?!"
He had promised to confront Erika in the next scenario, thus unofficially offering her a role.

In other words, the position of rival was already filled.
So he had no idea where he could place EVA, someone whose character overlapped with Erika's.

Additionally, EVA, who had seemed like a pretty irritating character when she made her debut in EP3, now seemed almost dull in comparison to Erika.

After all, Erika set the bar very high, thanks to her being the type who would resort to cheap tricks.

"So, that's the story.
Unless there ends up being some kind of a sprite bug in the script, you're not going to appear."

"Y-You're saying I'm inferior to this Erika girl?!
Why?!
In what way?!"

"...She's pretty much got all the specs you need.
She's annoying.
She's pathetic.
And most importantly, she's perverted.
It's almost too much for one character."

"W-w-whaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Are you trying to say I've lost my impact?!
Are you trying to say I'm a bad character?!" 

"...I mean.
She's a pervert who went out in the pouring rain, put on a swimsuit, and climbed the walls just to stick some packing tape onto windows.
Yes, Erika came in 6th place in the popularity poll and you were the 8th, only two places behind,
but she had almost double the votes."

"S-so...
you're saying a girl can get votes just by wearing a swimsuit?!" 

"It's 'cause men are weak against exposure.
Even a shorter skirt helps. 

Erika's only reaches her knees, but yours is a long one.
Besides, in this age of zettai ryouiki, you can't get anywhere without stockings or thigh highs.

Also, your hairstyle is very plain. 
Erika's popular twin-tail style is a huge improvement over that."

"Against her skirt, hairstyle, exposure, and perverted nature, you've got no chance.
She's better than you in every single aspect.
You have no place left in my story!"

"G-g-gyaaaaaaaaaah!!!"

Character overlaps with Erika's
�08595Never makes an appearance again!
�08595Fired from "Umineko"!
�08595Abandoned on a roadside.
�08595Starvation. 

Death!

"You can't dooooooooooooooo this to meeeeeeeeeeee!
Please, please, Master Battler!
I'll do everything you tell me to, if only you'll give me a role!..
Pleaaaase give me a part! If my skirt is too long, I'll shorten it!
If my hairstyle is the problem, I'll change it!"

"If it's exposure and a perverted nature you want, I'll do as you say, so I beg you, please, give me a role, Master Battler!"

"...So you're saying you'll shorten your skirt. But...
by how much?"

"Well, 
let's say, 
ehhhhh......
by four inches... (10cm)"
Battler snapped his fingers and EVA's skirt shrank by four inches,
but it was still fairly long.

"D...do it again..."

"It's barely reached your knees.
Do you really think that's good enough?.."

"...P..
...please, 
...make it shorter..."
The skirt became shorter and shorter.
In the end, it was so short that EVA had to frantically pull down the hem with both hands to keep her panties from being seen.
It was too short even by miniskirt standards!

"Well, I wonder if just fixing your skirt is enough to make you a competitor for Erika.
What about your hair, hm?"

"Y-yeah...

I'll wear a wig...
with...
twintails..."
"And how about the exposure and perverted nature?
Ihihihihi~!" 

Battler finally remembered that he was not just a mere scenario writer,
but a god called the Game Master.

That's right!
Here, I am a god! I'm free to do whatever I want.
Anyone who goes against me will get no role!

And thus, Battler sank into the dark temptation that plagued all witches...

EVA's dress had by now been remodeled into a super short miniskirt, and she was wearing black knee-socks to match.

Her hairstyle had been changed into twintails, and on top of that, 
she had even agreed to show up on screen with cat ears,
a bell collar,
in a sailor uniform, 

and bloomers with a tail attached: the special penalty game outfit!

But even with such harsh conditions thrust upon her, EVA, who didn't want to lose her role,
groveled on the floor and thanked Battler profusely...

Battler, who said with an attitude like that of a feudal lord that he would graciously grant her a role,
had become a wicked magistrate of a Game Master, to the point where even Beato would have been surprised...

"Wahahaha!
I am Battler, the new Game Master! 

Anyone who wants to play a role must come forward and apply!
And anyone who opposes me won't appear in the story at all!~ Muhahahaha!" 

This time, Rudolf and Kyrie showed up.

"Yo. Battler~
We're your family, right?
So we'll get roles, won't we?"

"The story has finally reached its second half.
It's time for the human side's counterattack.
We're quite enthusiastic about it ourselves."

"Kyrie? Sure. But this old bastard?.."

"Don't call me that!..
I'll buy you whatever you want!
I'll have a change of heart and become a really good daddy after this!
Alright?
Alright?!
C'mon, Kyrie can steal scenes with her great detective work.
And I could be the aloof action hero, c'mooon~!"

"Seems I've got no choice.
Be grateful to the generous Master Battler. 

I shall grant that wish of yours!"
Next were Krauss, Natsuhi and Jessica.

"H-hey, Battler...
Natsuhi, Jessica and I would like to request roles as well..."

"...We don't mind not being the center of attention.
If you could just depict us as a close family, that would be enough..."

"I wanna fight!
Let's make some noise and beat up witches and demons!"

"Hmmm~ I'll grant that, but only on one condition."

"W-what?.."

"Aunt Natsuhi, 
ehh...
I want you to become my lap pillow...
And also... um... 
could I call you 'M-m-mother'...?"
"I-It's not like I'm gonna force you into it, though.
Also, if you could, I'd like you to wear a swimsuit... 
Ah, and I'll give you the swimsuit myself!.. How about a school swimsuit?! 

Of course, you don't have to do it.
After all, I've got to find the six people to kill off on the first twilight from somewhere, hihihihi~!"

"B-Battler, you arsehole, what do you think you're saying to my mom?!"

"I'm not forcing you into anything!~
After all, I'm the great Game Master!~"

"...Khh.
F-fine...

...I...I will... wear a swimsuit ... and act as your... lap pillow..."

"Oh yeaaaaaaaaah!"

Next, George's family arrived carrying a box of biscuits.

"D-Do you, um... have conditions for our family to get screentime, too?"

"Ah'll do anythin'!..

Please, ya gotta give our family roles!
Pleaaaase!" 

"Forget me and my husband! 

But please, at least give George a wonderful role!!"

"Very well.
I gueeess I'll give George a kickass battle scene.
That alright?"

"R-Really?!
Thank ya, Battler!
Thank ya so much!"

"However!
Guhihihi!
I'll be borrowing Aunt Eva for one night! 

Her 
glamorous, 
outrageous, 
sexy body, ihihihi!
I'll have you cook for me in a bunny girl outfit, and maybe pour me an evening drink!~

Nfufufufufufu!"

"N-never!..

Leave Eva outta this!
I'll do anythin' ya want myself!.."

"...It's... it's okay, dear...

For George, I... will..." 

As Battler became more and more carried away, Rosa appeared before him.

"Battler...
Ehh..., about Maria..."

"Gufufufu~!
Of course I don't mind giving her one, but Aunt Rosa? 

If you ask someone for a favor, you've got to pay them back, riiiight?"

"This is... 
a gym uniform? 
W-why do you...
want me to wear?.."
"Aunt Rosaaa, I think I'll have you wash my back while wearing this gym uniform!~

Guhyahyahyaaah!~"

"...This is terrifying...
To think that Battler would succumb to the dark side of being the Game Master.."

"He's set up quite a charming show.
Pukuku!.."

"Oh, Ronove and Virgilia!
I owe you guys.

Don't worry, I'll make sure to give you roles in the next episode." 

"Oh my, that's unexpected.
I'm truly grateful."

"No matter what you may think, I don't forget my debts.
Ihihihi!"

"...Battler.
Everyone here desperately wants a role.
Please stop playing with people's feelings..."

"Even if it's your request, Virgilia, I'm afraid I can't comply!~ 

After all, I don't forget my debts, but I don't forget my grudges either~!
Oh, right, Ronove. 

Here's an announcement.
Please post it somewhere for me."

"Certainly.
...Oh, my, what is this?"

'The Seven Sisters of Purgatory won't be getting any screentime at all.
If anyone has any objections, come talk to me.'

...If something like this were posted,
there was no doubt the Seven Sisters would run off to see Battler.

Since the popular Seven Sisters appeared in every episode since EP2,
they felt that their role was already secure.

So why on Earth would they not be included this time?..

"We all know the answer!
It's all Lucy's fault!"

""""Yes, Big Sis!
All Lucy's fault!""""

"Why me?
What did I ever do?!.."

"Weeeelll,
Lucy."

"In EP3, you bullied Battler-kun too much~"

"As a representative for all the sisters, you tortured him more than anyone else.
Agh, I'm so jealous, I can't stand it!"

"Without a doubt, you have ruined Master Battler's mood."

""There's no doubt about it!""

"What are you gonna do, Lucy?!..
I promised to Ange that we'd meet each other in the story again!
Are you going to take some responsibility?!"

"I...
I'm not the only one at fault!.."

"""Nah!
Everything is Lucy's fault!"""
"Anyway,
let's all go apologize to Battler."

"I don't want to end up without a role, waaaaaah!" 

Battler was now wearing a cape he found somewhere,
and sitting on a ridiculous throne, looking down arrogantly.

The Seven Sisters kneeled before him, trying to somehow appeal to him for a role.

"...Yo, Lucifer.
Who'd think a day like this would ever come, eeeeeeh?
Ihihi..."

"Kh..."

"Master Battler!
We wanna have roles!"

""We'll do anything you want, so please give us roooooles!""

The sisters pleaded on their knees.

"Nfufufu.
It seems that only the six of you want to be in my story, but...
Lucifer alone does not."

"...Yeah! If I have to kneel before you for it, I don't care if I never get a role again for the rest of my life!.. Who would ever kneel before you!?"

"But the Seven Sisters of Purgatory are a unit of seven.
If one does not obey me, 
I guess that means none of you get any roles."
"""Ddddddon't dooooooooooo this tooooooooooo us, Master Battleeeeeeeeer!"""

"Stupid sis!
Your stubborness is causing all of us trouble!"

"Do it!
Kneel and apologise!"

"Yeah, yeah! Press your forehead to the floor and apologize!" 

The younger sisters all held Lucifer down together, and forced her to her knees by pushing her against the floor.

Lucifer refused to give it up, holding back tears and grinding her teeth.

"Master Battler, Lucy is also asking for forgiveness, so please calm your rage."

"Please give me a role where I meet a handsome prince!~"

"Please give me a role where I eat a lot of yummy food!~"

"Alright, alright.
Well, if I would be in a good mood right now, I would give you any role you want. 

But, ahhh, my shoulders are so stiff."

""Oka~y, we'll rub them!""

"Aah, my calves are pretty stiff, too. Could you rub those, too~?"

"Yes, leave it to me!"

"As you wish!" 

Mammon is taking care of my right calf.
Belph is massaging my left calf.

Asmo is taking care of my right arm.
Beelz is massaging my left arm.

Ahhh, my two arms...
are being held between warm fruits.
...W-What bliss...

...Damn, being a Game Master is fantastic...
All hail the Game Master! 

I am a god of this new game!
"The six younger sisters are now forgiven~
But I'm still mad at Lucifer for EP3.
You gouged and stabbed me so many times with that stake of yours, stabbing, stabbing, over and over!
Dammit, just remembering it is painful!"

"Oh well~ 
I suppose it's Battler's turn to stab Lucy."

"Great idea!
Until Master Battler is satisfied, he should torture her all night long!"

"W-what are you saying?! 

H-hey, let me go!"

"Oh, I know, Sis Lucifer.
Your weak spot is your back, right?.."

"L-Levia?!
H-how do you know that?!"

"Everyone knows your weak spot! 

You were the only one who thought we didn't know, weren't you!
You're too careless, Sis!"

"Hohoho, her back, you say? Hohoho!"

"W-wait!
Do you think I'll surrender if you do that?!
Do you really think I'll cry and beg for forgiveness?!"

"Ah, shut up, shut up!!
Learn my pain from the time when you stabbed me over and over! 

Is it here? 

Or maybe here? 

Take that, and that, and this too!"

"Ahhiiiiiiiiiiiii!"
"Or maybe it's this place?!"

"Ahaaaaaaa!

Noooo, 
forgive me, Master Battler, aaaaaaaa!"
...He finally got his chance at revenge that was never given to him before.
Battler was happily grinding against Lucifer's back... 

"Well, Master Battler?
Are you feeling any better?"

"Yep, I feel great...
My long-standing grudge has been totally cleared up, and I feel all fresh, like I've finally shed my skin!" 

Lucifer's shoulders heaved as she caught her breath. She had collapsed with her clothes in disarray, and it looked very much like the aftermath of...
well... 

"So do we all get roles now?.."

"Sure!
I've resolved all of my grudges!
Don't worry, your screentime is secure!
Uhahahahahahaha!"

"Then, I want a scene where I meet a handsome prince!"

"I want a role where I eat lots of food!"

"I don't need any big scenes, but make sure I'm in the 7th game, too!"

"I would like to fight against a formidable enemy, and fall beautifully in battle."

"Hey, hey!
If you ask for all that at once, Master Battler's going to get confused!
Write your requests on paper instead!"

"...I'm... 
fine... 
with even the smallest of roles...
...I won't defy you again, 
so can I please 
have a role too?.."
"What are you on about? Sis Lucy, you always stand out the most! I'm so jelaous, argh!"

"Wahahaha!
The Game Master is a god! I'll grant any wish you may have!
Anything at all! 

Oh?
Someone else came.
Could it be the Chiester sisters this time?
Or maybe Dlanor's group?
Come to think of it, Ange, you've got some nerve, not coming to congratulate me when you're my own little sister!"

"I've already received a full-body massage from the Seven Sisters.
Maybe I'll have the Chiester Sisters wipe the sweat off my brow with their tails~?
And just what should I get out of Dlanor? 

Uhyahyahyahaaaaa!"

...And so,
Battler has exhausted the limits of tyranny as a Game Master,
enjoying his newfound harem to the fullest.

However, in this world, people have responsibilities as well as rights.

Battler has made use of his rights as Game Master and now he had to fulfill the responsibility to grant their requests.

"Excuse me?
...I wrote down all the requests on paper."

"Ahh, thanks, Virgilia!
Let me see, let me see.

...Woah, that's a lot."

"Pukuku!
You are a god of the gameboard, Master Battler.
There is no wish you cannot grant.
And that is why these demands are somewhat extravagant."

"...Well then, Battler?
...What kind of scenario can you make to fit in all of these requests?..
And all of it is just one episode..." 

[List of role requests for EP6]
�09632 Genji
The refined supporting character.
While making cocktails in the guesthouse lounge, I will talk about the past.
We hear a bit about my past from a mid-boss character, and we get a feel for how strong I was in the past.

�09632 Nanjo
A super surgeon. Even when I have no surgical tools, I will use my daily supplies to perform a successful surgery.
On top of that, I will have a fight scene where I use surgical tools as weapons. 

�09632 Kumasawa
Always witnessing major scenes.
Because of my plentiful life experience, I sense that something seems out of place at the crime scene! 

But I'm killed by the culprit before I can do anything.
My death should be a real tearjerker.
Of course, for the music in that scene, a new sad song should be ordered from dai. 

�09632 Gohda
I'll cook lots of delicious food! I would like for the scene about my dinner orchestra to be at least 50,000 characters long.
And then everyone gives my wonderful cooking a standing ovation! 

I'll even receive a kiss on the cheek from Madam out of admiration!

Of course, my action scene will take place in the kitchen.
The viewers will be lead to believe that it is a gun fight, but the real fight will only begin once I lose my rifle.
I will blow away the terrorists with my aikido techniques! 
My catchphrase is:
"In the kitchen, I am immortal!" 
�09632 EVA
I'll be revived as a villain who surpasses Erika!
The brutal serial murders will commence once more! 
Finally, I want to be involved in an intense battle with Battler!
The length of that scene should be at least 100,000 characters.

The battle scene should use five new fight songs made exclusively for EVA.
Furthermore, I must be one of the strongest characters in the fighting game spin-off!
And Frontier Works must release a body pillow of me along with one of their DVDs! 

�09632 KraussThe battle against the Golden Witch will head towards the true fight:
the fight for gold, for finances!
Krauss, who had always played the part of the lowly buffoon, finally awakens as the Golden Sorcerer!

Pattern blue, confirmed as bubble!"

"Riemann has five minutes of active time remaining!..
The investors are being cut off one by one!"

"Injection of public funds severed, sending coercion for government backing for Merrill Lynch!"

"It's no good, we cannot send it!"

"What did you say?!!"
"Commander Krauss,

...w-we have received a call from the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan..."

"...It's been a hundred years."

"Yes, there is no mistake.

this is the Second World Financial Crisis, the Riemann Bankruptcy." 
�09632 Natsuhi
The story has been quite turbulent until now, so this time I would like a calm romance story aimed towards adults.

My husband throws a snowball at me, and when I catch it it splits apart, ...and I find an engagement ring inside.
Kya~ 

�09632 Jessica
To hell with theories and reasoning!
Honestly, I don't give a crap about the mystery.
Time for the exhilarating action chapter, with the thriller of Jessica beating up and knocking down the nasty villains with her brass knuckles!
I want the director to be Stephen Chow Sing-Chi.

I'll get cornered towards the end, but then Kanon will gallantly dash in to save me!
For a more detailed explanation of that scene, see page 735 of the appendix!

�09632 Hideyoshi
Returning from the frontlines to find his hometown burnt to the ground.
No house, no family, no assets.
Documenting the man who had lost everything but became the owner of a restaurant chain from scratch, an exhilarating color film based on a true story!..

the success stories start building up from there!

For details, see "Excitement! The Chronicles of an Exemplary Man's One-man Struggles.
~Stories of Success of a Restaurant Chain Owner~"
It'll be sold at the company's sales department and every chain establishment for 1800 yen.
New employees will be required to read the script during their training period! 

�09632 Eva
Dejected by the steady ruin of the Ushiromiya family, Eva attempts to revive it.

Women should do housework and raise children?

Women should stay out of the way?

Stay out of the way yourself, Krauss!
Just you watch, the era of men is long over!
With intelligence and strength,
with gentleness and kindness, I'll play a huge role by helping my husband!
When my husband's company is in trouble, I'll use my womanly wit and wisdom to salvage it,
and before long my role in the story will become to revive the Ushiromiya family.
In the end, what I've done will be acknowledged by Kinzo, and he will accept me as the next head.

In the climax, Krauss and a bunch of other hoodlums will attack my husband, and when he's in trouble, I'll use my famous legs to kick them back!
The lead actress should be me. If that's not possible, then Nobuko Miyamoto.
Naturally, the director should be Juzo Itami. 

�09632 George

I'd like a peaceful and loving depiction of how the romance between me and Shannon started.
The scene still hasn't been shown in the original work, after all.

It happened on the usual day of the family conference.
I wonder how many years ago?..
Haha, remembering it makes me feel a bit embarrassed.

That day, I had been wearing a hat.
It was blown away by a strong wind
and went flying away on the beach.

At that moment, Shannon showed up.
We went to go search the beach together for the hat. 
We just couldn't find it anywhere,
no matter how many times the two of us scoured the beach searching for it.

We never found it, in the end.
But since it would've been boring to just search for it in silence,
we were talking to each other the whole time.

That was when I heard that she wanted to go see an aquarium.
By coincidence, I had a friend who was a curator.
I arranged it so that just the two of us could specially visit the aquarium on one of the days it was closed.

There, I apologised to her for two things.
One was that I wouldn't get to show her the crowds of people at the aquarium.
And the other one was that... I never owned a hat.
(Hehe)

"Enough already!!!

What the hell...
How much more is left?!
...Over a half?!.."

"...I feel these are fitting demands to match your selfish whims, Battler..."

"Well,
now you have to write a scenario that answers all of these requests.
...But Game Masters have a limit on the time they have to write..." 

"A time limit?!

How much do I have left?!"

"Well, to put things bluntly, until Winter Comiket." 

"The people at the press factory have their own circumstances as well, so the actual deadline for delivery is even sooner...
It seems this year's winter will be quite cold.
It isn't unusual for the factories to be located in mountains...

It's possible the factory could be shut down because of snow, and the master disc won't reach us in time."

"Come now, Master Battler, you should begin writing the new scenario that meets all of these requests!

...Ah, and if you would allow it,
I would be most pleased if you were to write that I become the wild captain of a pirate ship and voyage to the ends of the earth."

"Ah, ...then
I would be happy if you allowed me to perform a 17-year and a 1000-year commemoration live concert...

What did you say?
I can't hear you!"

"Eh...
Can Ushiromiya Battler ask for something too?.."

"Mm? What is it?"

"Can we just...
forget any of this happened?.."

""Nope.""
"I got carried away, I sincerely apologize!
Please save me, Lady Virgilia, Lord Ronove..."

"Oh dear, I suppose we have no choice..."

"Pukuku.
If you wish for us to lead the episode, of course we will undertake that task.
However, we will add our own demands to the scenario as well."

"I'll accept anything!..
...???
What's with the horrifying faces?"

"...RudoBat.

GohBat."
"Pukuku!
Make sure to remember RonoBat as well!"
"...What on Earth are you on about?..
What's this about bats? 

Is this some kind of new varbal tic..?"

""Ehehehehehhee!""
